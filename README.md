# Resume attempt
Here can be found my attempt to code out my resume in html & css. 
The resume consists of my title, skills, work experience and references in that order. I wasnt able to finish each section to my inteded extent, 
but listed bellow can be found my progress and my future plans. 

Title:
    Here I just wanted to place basic info abbout myself such as my name, contact information and what I do (I make things).
    Future plans for the title section would be to add the contact section to the far right corner so that its availible, but out the way.

Skills:
    Here I aimed to have 4-5 boxes of similar skills.
    Future plans: what I wanted was to use a mix of hover and css states to show more info on the skills shown when hovered or clicked. 
    Idealy, the hover would show descriptions/ explanations of what each skill was and the click (state change) would open up a new section
    bellow the skills section that explained my profficiency and work done with the skills. I'll start with the hover idea first and when 
    I feel comfortable with that, move onto css state changes (the harder task in my opinion)

Work Experience:
    Here can be found the list of my past job titles and their description. On the left are the job titles listed chronologically by year worked. 
    On the right can be found the job descriptions (what the job entails, the employer name, location, pictures of workspace, etc). 
    The job listed is my most current job, but my goal was again to use css states to hide/show the different job descriptions depending on which job title is selected. 
    Future plans would be to get the css states up and runing... that and to gather more pictures of my workspaces/ the work that I do.

Refferences:
    As the name implies, here are the refferences that I want to include. I originally intended to make this area interactive, 
    but I feel keeping it as simple as possible would be better. The end goal here would be to have sort of buisiness cards for each of my refferences, giving their name, number, how I know them, and whatever their known for. Ill proabably add headshots if they have good enough photos availible (or I can take the photos myself...that I know they wont mind)

Other future plans:
    - fixing the padding/spacing between text and the borders
        I played around with pading briefly but what I feel I need to do is add padding to the text istelf and not the whole container. at least that way, the text isnt riding the edge of the borders. I also dont know if padding is what I want to use, but If it's not, I can easily find the solution online later so im not too worried about this. I just need more practice with text styling. 

    - Adding mobile scaling 
        Due to my tie restrictions, I wasnt able to work on the mobile version of the site, but What im worried about would be the scaling of multiple grids inside of grids and if that would pose as an issue or not... Ill try this over break

    -Adding slight dropshadow between each section
        For styling purposes and also to help separate each section

    - Adding pictures...
